# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of credit card transactions and detecting credit card fraud. The focus is on prioritizing precision for non-fraudulent transactions and recall for fraudulent transactions, with models being fine-tuned accordingly.

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. It consists of various features including transaction amount, type of transaction (online or chip and pin), time of transaction, etc.
